It allows the micro to middle-size market deals including Merger & Acquisition and securities underwriting processes can be executed on high-speed timeframe, high-rate success and low cost scale.


## Business Activities

The foundamental AI technology is capable of designing business cases, value creation and integation plans. When execute post-merger integrations and even SEC filings, the well trained  and sophisticated AI model can solve the high cost post merger issues.

## Results

* the platform has changed on who and how does the investnment banking deals especially the mergers and acquisitions. M&A is the mainstream among mid-size to large companies. It is increasingly a top strategic priority for the CEOs and large shareholders. Companies are also increasingly becoming serial acquirers as the past two decades have shown that
leveraging a serial acquirer strategy to M&A creates shareholder value more predictably than focusing on large mergers or other strategies. As a result of the platform, there would be more companies to initiate their M & A on Peniel platform with its sophisticated bankers and generative AIs.

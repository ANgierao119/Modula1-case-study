## Overview and Origin

* PENIEL AI is a newly incorporated tech company in DE, United States. The founder is Angelina Rao, who is studying in a software engineering boot camp at Columbia University. She has been working in a boutique investment banking firm as an M&A director for nine years. She is always thinking about working more efficiently, so she started developing an AI-powered investment banking platform on which recently advanced AI can handle more complicated tasks that require complex reasoning in unique circumstances. It allows micro to middle-size market deals, including mergers and acquisitions and securities underwriting processes, to execute on high-speed timeframes, high-rate success, and low-cost scales.


## Business Activities

* The critical tasks AI could help both the buy and sell sides find the right prospects and define M & A strategy, theme, and ideal target profiles. Within the internal CRM AI, they can communicate and develop relations with target companies. Bankers can predict metrics and deal with outcomes and risks. The fundamental AI technology can design business cases, value creation, and integration plans. The well-trained and sophisticated AI model can solve the high-cost post-merger issues when executing post-merger integrations and even SEC filings.

* Due to the high cost and lengthy process, usually only large-scale investment banking firms can have the capacity to close more significant M&A deals. Peniel provides the platform to enable independent investment bankers, institutional investors, corporations, hedge funds, etc., to work on small- to large-size deals.

* Not like other M&A or data research platforms, Peniel is the only zero upfront fee M&A investment banking platform charged only based on successful closing. 

* Peniel uses Python Machine learning to build all models and integrates extensive data research using an API interface.

## Landscape

* Peniel is Brokedealer AI and will be the leading innovative AI fintech in the future. 

## Results

* The platform has changed on who and how the investment banking deals, especially the mergers and acquisitions. M&A is the mainstream among mid-size to large companies. It is increasingly a top strategic priority for the CEOs and large shareholders. Companies are also increasingly becoming serial acquirers as the past two decades have shown that
leveraging a serial acquirer strategy to M&A creates shareholder value more predictably than focusing on large mergers or other strategies. As a result of the platform, there would be more companies to initiate their M&A on the Peniel platform with its sophisticated bankers and generative AIs. 


## Recommendations

* We also plan to build an AI chatbot to help clients 24/7 and internationally. It ll help clients save more time from looking up from Edgar, SEC for simply 10-k or 13D documents to find out who the largest shareholders, etc. information... and so on
   AI is helping the world but will never replace humans; we ll always have our professional human software engineering team working behind the AI that works for humans.
